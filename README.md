# QTProjects

Welcome to **QTProjects**, a collection of Qt-based applications designed to explore and visualize graph algorithms in an interactive way. Whether you are studying graph theory or working on algorithmic challenges, these projects provide hands-on tools to experiment with various concepts.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🖊️ Interactive Graph Editor  
- A dynamic interface that enables users to build and modify graphs intuitively.  
- Supports both directed and undirected graph structures.  

### 🔍 Shortest Path in a Matrix (BFS)  
- Implements **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to determine the shortest path between a start position and an exit in a matrix.  
- Highlights accessible areas and path traversal.  

### 🏗️ Advanced Graph Operations  
- Executes **Topological Sorting** using Depth-First Search (DFS) while maintaining sorting constraints.  
- Identifies the **Root Node** of a graph.  
- Validates if a given structure qualifies as a **tree**.  
- Detects **Connected Components**, assigning distinct colors to each component.  
- Visualizes **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**, with each SCC uniquely highlighted.  

### 🔗 Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms  
- Supports **Prim’s, Kruskal’s, and Borůvka’s algorithms**, along with an additional MST method.  
- Allows users to define edge weights interactively.  

### 🌊 Maximum Network Flow (Ford-Fulkerson)  
- Implements the **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm** to calculate the **maximum flow** in a network.  
- Updates the residual network visualization at regular intervals.  
- Clearly marks the **minimum cut** at the conclusion of the process.
